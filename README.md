# How to use feature flags in Inferno.js (WIP - Not ready)

<!-- TODO: Update the below link when article is published -->
[Read the blog post here](https://configcat.com/blog/)

This is a fictional blog website created to demo the use of feature flags in [Inferno.js](https://www.infernojs.org/). I've created a Newsletter component, as shown below. In the article I discussed how to link it to a feature flag. In this way, when I toggle the feature flag on, the Newsletter section will be shown on the website without the need for editing and redeploying the app.
